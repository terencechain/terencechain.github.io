# Hi, I'm Terence

I'm [passionate about open-source](https://github.com/terencechain) and have been actively involved in Ethereum protocol development since late 2018.

## Highlights

### Ethereum

- Maintainer of [Prysm](https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm), an Ethereum consensus layer client developed in Go.
- Contributed to Ethereum's [Consensus Specs](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs), [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost), and [Builder 
Specs](https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs).

### L2 Works

- Worked on permissionless challenge game with [BoLD](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold/blob/main/docs/research-specs/BOLDChallengeProtocol.pdf) and its 
[implementation](https://github.com/OffchainLabs/bold).
- Currently looking into decentralized sequencing, interop protocols, and various other topics.
